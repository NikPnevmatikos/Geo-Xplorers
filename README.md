# Geo-Xplorers

GeoXplorers is a web Application designed for users to discover points of
interest by using Google Maps combined with our search filters. The main
technologies that were used are ReactJS, Django, SQLite. Users can search for specific
keywords and apply filters to refine their result!
To enhance the user experience, GeoXplorers offers user registration and login
functionality to make an account, allowing logged in users to save their searches and
access them at any time. They can also receive real-time notifications about newly
added points of interest that align with their saved searches, ensuring they stay
informed and up-to-date.
GeoXplorers gives the capability to the website’s staff to contribute to the
platform's content. Staff members can add new categories and new points of interest
by just uploading TCV files with all the required information.
With its minimalistic interface, search features, personalized saved searches,
and seamless integration with Google Maps, GeoXplorers offers a unique and
user-friendly platform for users to explore and discover new exciting locations.
